<blockquote>How to use your system's tape drive (diskette drive?) to store files.
How to do your own backups, and why they are important.  Other uses

</blockquote>
<p><h1><a name="uh-0" href="Tar.html#toc-uh-0">Why bother with Backups?</a></h1>As someone who has been an end user and a system manager, 
I strongly believe that every user should understand the importance of
security. Not only in preventing others from accessing and modifying your
data, but also in storing and recovering data you may have deleted
on purpose or through accident.
<dl><dd><br>

<b>If you have data that is important to you, you should<br>
have a known backup.<br>

</b></dl>
<p>Accidents and oversights happen. 
Tapes can be damaged, lost, or misslabeled.
Assume your system administrator is top notch.
The best administrator can recover your lost data 99%
of the time.
There is still a small chance that the files you need
might not be recovered. 
Can you afford to duplicate months of effort 1 per cent of the time?
No.
<p>An experienced programmer learns to be pessimistic. 
Typically, this important fact is learned the hard way.
Perhaps a few hours is lost. Perhaps days. Sometimes months
are lost.
<p>Here are some common situations:
<p><OL><li>A user works on a program all day. At the end of the day, the program
is deleted by accident. The system manager cannot recover the file.
A day's work has been lost.
<li>A programmer tries to clean up a project directory.
Instead of typing
"rm *.o" the programmer types
"rm * .o" and the entire directory is lost.
<li>A user deletes a file by accident.
After a few days, the user asks the system administrator to recover
the file. The incremental backup system has re-used the
only tape the missing file was on.
<li>A large project is archived on a magnetic tape and deleted
from the disk. A year later, some of the information is needed.
The tape has a bad block at the beginning. The system manager
must learn how to recover data from a bad tape. The attempt is often
unsuccessful. The information is lost forever, and must be
recreated, at the cost of months of effort.
<li>Someone breaks into a computer and accesses confidential information.
<li>A fire breaks out in the computer room. The disks and
<b>all</b> of the backup tapes are lost. 
</OL><p>Gulp! 
I scared myself.
Excuse me for a few minutes while I load a tape....
<p>Ah! I feel better now.
As I was saying, being pessimistic has it's
advantages.
<p><h1><a name="uh-1" href="Tar.html#toc-uh-1">Making a backup using tar</a></h1>Making a backup is easy. Get a blank tape and learn how to load
it onto the tape drive. Also learn how to write-protect the tape.
Put a label on the tape.
Then do the following:
<dl><dd>cd<br>
tar c .<br>

</dl>
<p>The
"cd" command moves you to your home directory.
You could back up any directory the same way.
<p>The
<b>tar</b> command, which is an abbreviation of <b>t</b>ape <b>ar</b>chive,
copies the current directory, specified by the
".," to the default tape drive. 
The 
"c" argument specifies the
"create" mode of 
<b>tar</b>. 
<p>You might get an error. 
Something about device
"rmt8" off line. 
Don't worry. I exaggerated slightly when
I said 
<b>tar</b> was easy to use.
The tape device
<b>tar</b> uses by default is
"/dev/rmt8." There are several types of tape units, and not all
can be referred to using that name.
Some system administrators will link that name to the actual
device, which makes 
<b>tar</b> easier to use. But if that doesn't work, you need to specify
additional arguments to 
<b>tar</b>. 
<p><h1><a name="uh-2" href="Tar.html#toc-uh-2">Syntax of the tar command</a></h1>
<p>Most Unix commands follow a certain style when arguments are specified.
<b>Tar</b> does not follow this convention, so you must be careful to
use 
<b>tar</b> properly.
If the standard was followed, then the following might be an example
of dumping the current directory to the 1/2 inch tape cartridge,
verbose mode, block size of 20:
<dl><dd>tapedump -c -v -b 20 -f /dev/rmt8 .<br>

</dl>
<p>Instead, all the flags are in the first argument, and the 
parameters to those flags follow the first argument, in order of the
flags specified:
<dl><dd>tar cvbf 20 /dev/rmt8 .<br>

</dl>
<p>The same command can be specified in a different way by changing 
the order of the letters in the first argument:
<dl><dd>tar cvfb /dev/rmt8 20 .<br>

</dl>
<p>The only key letter that has a fixed location is the first
one, which must specify if you are reading or writing an archive.
The most common key letters, and the functions they perform are;
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Key Letter</th>
    <th align=center>Function</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>c</td>
    <td>Create an archive</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>x</td>
    <td>eXtract an archive</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>t</td>
    <td>Table of contents</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Some versions of tar require a hyphen before the letter.
It is optional on SunOS.
<p><h1><a name="uh-3" href="Tar.html#toc-uh-3">What is the name of the tape drive?</a></h1>
<p>Part of the difficulty in using 
<b>tar</b> is figuring out which filename to use for which device.
If you have a 1/2" tape drive, try
<dl><dd>tar cf /dev/rmt8 .<br>

</dl>
<p>If you has a 1/4" tape cartridge, try
<dl><dd>tar cf /dev/rst8 .<br>

</dl>
<p>If this doesn't work, then try changing the 
"8" to a
"0." You can also list the devices in the 
<b>/dev</b> directory and look for one that has the most recent usage:
<dl><dd>ls -lut /dev/r{m,s}t*<br>

</dl>
<p>Some unix systems use different standards for naming magnetic tapes.
There might be a
"h" at the end of a name for high density.
When in doubt, examine the major and minor numbers (using the
<b>ls -l</b> command, and read the appropriate manual page, which
can be found by searching through the possible entries using
<dl><dd>man -k mt<br>

</dl>
<p>and
<dl><dd>man -k tape<br>

</dl>
<p><h1><a name="uh-4" href="Tar.html#toc-uh-4">More on tape names</a></h1>The names of tape devices always start with a 
"r" by convention, which suggests this is a 
"raw" device that does not support a file system.
If the first two letters are
"nr" then this suggests a
"no-rewind" operation.
Normally the tape is automatically rewound when you are done.
If you repeat the 
<b>tar</b> command, it will overwrite the first dump.
As this can waste large amounts of tape, use the
"nr" name of the tape to put several dumps on one tape.
As an example, if you wanted to dump three separate directories
to a 1/4 inch tape cartridge, you can type
<dl><dd>cd dir1<br>
tar cf /dev/nrst8 .<br>
cd dir2<br>
tar cf /dev/nrst8 .<br>
cd dir3<br>
tar cf /dev/rst8 .<br>

</dl>
<p>Note that the third dump does not use the
"no-rewind" name of the device, so that it will rewind when done.
<p>To examine a tape without extracting any files, 
get a table of contents and use the key letter
"t" or
"tv" instead of the
"c." The
"v" flag gives a more verbose listing.
<p>If you want to examine the third dump file, you can either 
use
<b>tar</b> twice with the 
"no-rewind " names, or you can skip forward one or more dump files
my using the
<b>mt</b> (magnetic tape)
command to skip forward 2:
<dl><dd>mt -f /dev/nrst8 fsf 2<br>

</dl>
<p>SunOS 4.1 has added a new convenience to the
<b>tar</b> command. If you defined an environment variable
<b>TAPE</b>: 
<dl><dd>setenv TAPE /dev/rst8<br>

</dl>then you don't have to specify it for the
<b>mt</b> or
<b>tar</b> commands.
<p><h1><a name="uh-5" href="Tar.html#toc-uh-5">Using tar without a tape</a></h1>
<p>Your personal workstation probably doesn't have
a tape drive connected.
This makes creating
<b>tar</b> backup files slightly more complicated.
If you have an account on a machine with a tape drive,
and the directory is NFS mounted, you can just 
<b>rlogin</b> to the other machine and use 
<b>tar</b> to backup your directory.
<p>If the directory is not NFS mounted, or it is mounted 
but you have permission problems accessing your own files,
you can use 
<b>tar</b>, 
<b>rsh</b> and
<b>dd</b> to solve this dilemma.
The syntax is confusing, but if you forget, you can use
<dl><dd>man tar<br>

</dl>to refresh your memory.
The command to dump the current directory to
a tape in a remote machine called 
<i>zephyrus</i>, the command is:
<dl><dd>tar cvfb - 20 . | rsh zephyrus dd of=/dev/rmt0 obs=20b<br>

</dl>
<p>Here, the output file of
<b>tar</b> is
<b>-</b>, which 
<b>tar</b> interprets as standard input if 
<b>tar</b> is reading a tape, or standard output
if 
<b>tar</b> is creating a tape.
<p>the
<b>dd</b> command does a data copy from standard input to the device
<b>/dev/rmt0</b>. 
<p>This example assumes you can 
use
<b>rsh</b> without requiring a password.
You can add your current machine's name to the remote
<i>.rhost</i> file if you get a password prompt
when you use
<b>rlogin</b> to access this machine.
<p>If you do not have an account, you might be able to let a friend 
let you use their account temporarily.
<dl><dd><br>

<b>Don't Do This!</b> <br>

</dl>
<p>I have to warn you about this because there is no secure way to do this.
Whenever you allow someone else access to your account,
they can create a program that lets them back into your account
without your knowledge.
This also holds true whenever someone lets you access their account.
That is, if someone allows you to type in a command from their
workstation or terminal, you may not be executing the programs you think you are.
One of these programs might capture your password!
<dl><dd><br>

<b>YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!</b> <br>

</dl>
<p>In an effort to be complete, 
I will describe how to use a remote tape when your account has a different name
on the remote machine. 
Let's assume your account on the remote machine is
"sam." You could add a line to his
<i>.rhosts</i> file with the following format:
<dl><dd><br>

<i>machinename username</i> <br>

</dl>
<p>where these match your machine and user name.
You could then use the command:
<dl><dd>tar cvfb - 20 . | rsh zephyrus -l sam dd of=/dev/rmt0 obs=20b<br>

</dl>
<p>to access the remote account.
<p>The alert reader will realize that this is the same procedure used to allow
someone else to have access to a remote account.
I must stress that allowing someone else access to your account
temporarily gives them the chance to access your account forever.
I know of no simple, yet secure way to solve this problem.
(I would like electronic mail if you think you know a solution that doesn't
require writing
a special purpose program.)
<p><h1><a name="uh-6" href="Tar.html#toc-uh-6">Using tar to create disk files</a></h1>
<p>Because of Unix's device independence, you can send a
<b>tar</b> archive to a pipe or to a Unix file.
Both commands create a file called
<i>project.tar</i>: 
<dl><dd>tar cf project.tar project<br>
tar cf - project &gt;project.tar<br>

</dl>
<p>This is a convenient way to create an archive of a directory and move it
to a different disk.
This file does take up a lot of room.
You can recover some of this room by running 
<b>compress</b> on the 
<b>tar</b> file:
<dl><dd>compress project.tar<br>

</dl>
<p>This creates a file called
<i>project.tar.Z</i> and deletes
<i>project.tar</i>. This is a convenient way to save disk space,
because a compressed tar file or a directory is typically smaller that the 
original directory.
Once the tar file is created, the original directory can be deleted.
The directory can be recreated with these steps:
<dl><dd>uncompress project.tar.Z<br>
tar xf project.tar<br>

</dl>
<p>
<b>Tar</b>, by default, restores the original modification times.
The
<b>m</b> option suppresses this.
The times of the last modification is important because
<b>make</b> uses this information to keep track of
file dependencies.
This makes
<b>tar</b> a convenient program to copy directories, unlike
<b>cp -r.</b> To use
<b>tar</b> to copy a directory, this example from the manual pages can be used:
<dl><dd>tar cf - . | (cd todir;tar xfBp -)<br>

</dl>
<p><h1><a name="uh-7" href="Tar.html#toc-uh-7">Excluding/Including files when using tar</a></h1>
<p>
<b>Tar</b> will archive binary and source files.
To speed up the archiving and reduce the archive size,
most project directories have a special command in the
<b>make</b> file that deletes all files that can be recreated.
This is typically
<dl><dd>make clean<br>

</dl>
<p>that may just delete the executable file, object files and possibly a core dump:
<dl><dd># contents of makefile<br>
clean:<br>
     /bin/rm -f *.o program core<br>

</dl>
<p>
<b>Tar</b> has a special flag that helps you make snapshots of a project directory.
If you specify the flag
<b>F</b> then this tells 
<b>tar</b> to not include the Source Code Control System (SCCS) directory.
If you specify two
<b>F</b> arguments, then this makes the restriction stronger, and files
with the names
<b>core</b>, 
<b>a.out</b>, 
<b>errs</b>, and any file ending with
<b>.o</b> will not be written to the
<b>tar</b> file.
So, to create a backup of a project directory, the following
command is used:
<dl><dd>tar cvfFF project.tar project<br>

</dl>
<p>This is a convenient way to give someone all the current files
needed to build an executable, without giving them every SCCS version
of every file.
<p>This is convenient, but it may include files you don't want.
<b>Make</b> creates files starting with a
<b>,</b> to keep track of dependencies.
Various editors create backup files ending with
<b>%</b> or
<b>~</b>. I often keep the original copy of a program with the
<b>.orig</b> extension, and old versions with a
<b>.old</b> extension.
There may be some binary files that you don't
want to archive, but don't want to delete either.
<p>The solution is to use the
<b>X</b> flag to tar.
This flag specifies that the matching argument to 
<b>tar</b> is a filename that lists files to exclude from the archive.
Here is an example:
<dl><dd>find project -type f -print | <br>
egrep  '/, | %$ | ~$ | .old$ | SCCS | /core$ | .o$ | .orig$' &gt;Exclude<br>
tar cvfX project.tar Exclude project<br>

</dl>
<p>In this example,
<b>find</b> lists all files in the directories, but does not
print the directory names explicitly.
If you have a directory name in an excluded list, 
it will also exclude all the files inside the directory.
<b>Egrep</b> is then used as a filter to exclude certain files from the archive.
Here,
<b>egrep</b> is given several regular expressions to match certain files.
This expression seems complex but is simple once you understand
a few special characters:
<p>
The slash is not a special character. 
However, since no filename
can contain a slash, it matches the beginning of a filename,
as output by the 
<b>find</b> command.
The vertical bar separates each regular expression.
The dollar sign is one of the two regular expression
"anchors," and specifies the end of the line, or filename in this case.
The other anchor, which specifies the beginning of the line, is
"^." But because we are matching filenames output by
<b>find</b>, the only filenames that can match
"^" are those in the top directory.
Normally the dot matches any character in a regular
expression. Here, we want to match the actual
character
".," which is why the backslash is used to
"quote" or
"escape" the normal meaning.
<p>A breakdown of the patterns and examples of the files
that match these patterns are given below:
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Pattern</th>
    <th>Matches files</th>
    <th>Used by</th>
  </tr>
<tr><td>/,</td><td>starting with comma</td><td>make dependency files</td></tr>
<tr><td>%$</td><td>ending with %</td><td>Textedit backup files</td></tr>
<tr><td>~$</td><td>ending with ~</td><td>emacs backup files</td></tr>
<tr><td>.old$</td><td>ending with .old</td><td>old copies</td></tr>
<tr><td>SCCS</td><td>in SCCS directory</td><td>Source Code Control System</td></tr>
<tr><td>/core$</td><td>with name of "core"</td><td>core dump</td></tr>
<tr><td>.o$</td><td>ending with .o</td><td>Object files</td></tr>
<tr><td>.orig$</td><td>ending with .orig</td><td>programmer to show original version</td></tr>
  </table>

<p>Instead of specifying which files are to be excluded, you can specify which 
files to archive using the
<b>-I</b> option.
As with the exclude flag, specifying directories tell
<b>tar</b> to include (or exclude) entire directories.
You should also note that the syntax of the
<b>-I</b> option is different that the typical
<b>tar</b> flag.
This example dumps all C and
<b>make</b> files;
<dl><dd>find project -type f -print | <br>
egrep  '.c | .h | akefile$'&gt;Include<br>
tar cvf project.tar -I Include<br>

</dl>
<p>I suggest using
<b>find</b> to create the include or exclude file.
You can edit it afterwards, if you wish.
Extra spaces at the end of any lines will cause that file
to be ignored.
<p>Another way to debug the
<b>output</b> of the
<b>find</b> command is to use
<i>/dev/null</i> as the output file:
<dl><dd> tar cvfX /dev/null Exclude project<br>

</dl>
<p><h1><a name="uh-8" href="Tar.html#toc-uh-8">Including other directories</a></h1>
<p>There are times when you want to make an archive of several directories.
You may want to archive a source directory and
another directory like
<i>/usr/local</i>. The natural. but wrong way to do this is to use the command:
<dl><dd>tar cvf /dev/rmt8 project /usr/local<br>

</dl>
<b>When using tar, You must never specify a directory name starting with a 
"/." 
</b>This will cause problems when you restore a directory, as you will see later.
The proper way to do this is to use the
<b>-C</b> flag:
<dl><dd>tar cvf /dev/rmt8 project -C /usr local<br>

</dl>
<p>This will archive
<i>/usr/local/...</i> as
<i>"local/"</i> 
<p><h1><a name="uh-9" href="Tar.html#toc-uh-9">Restoring files with tar</a></h1>
<p>There are several ways to specify a directory to archive.
If the directory is under the current directory,
I have already given the example:
<dl><dd>tar c project<br>

</dl>
<p>A similar way to specify the same directory is
<dl><dd>tar c ./project<br>

</dl>
<p>If you are currently in the directory you want archived, you
can type:
<dl><dd>tar c .<br>

</dl>
<p>Another way to archive the current directory is
to type
<dl><dd>tar c *<br>

</dl>
<p>Here, the shell expands the
<b>*</b> character to the files in the current directory.
However, it does not match files starting with a
<b>.</b>, which is why the previous technique is preferred.
<p>This causes a problem when restoring a directory from a
<b>tar</b> archive.
You may not know if an archive was created using
<b>.</b> or the directory name.
<p>I always check the names of the files before restoring an archive:
<dl><dd>tar t<br>

</dl>
<p>If the archive loads the files into the current directory,
I create a new directory, change to it, and extract the files.
<p>If the archive restores the directory by name, then
I restore the files into the current directory.
<p><h1><a name="uh-10" href="Tar.html#toc-uh-10">Restoring a few files</a></h1>
<p>If you want to restore a single file, get the pathname
of the file as
<b>tar</b> knows it, using the
<b>t</b> flag.
You must specify the exact filename, because
<b>filename</b> and
<b>./filename</b> are not the same.
You can combine this in one command
by using:
<dl><dd>tar xvf /dev/rst0 `tar tf /dev/rst0  | grep filename`<br>

</dl>
<p>Whenever you use
<b>tar</b> to restore a directory, you must always
specify 
<b>some</b> filename.
If none is specified, no files are restored.
<p> There is still the problem of restoring a directory whose pathname
starts with 
<b>/</b>. Because
<b>tar</b> restores a file to the pathname specified in the archive,
you cannot change 
<b>where</b> the file will be restored.
The danger is that you may either overwrite some existing files, or
you will not be able to restore the files because you don't
have permissions.
<p>You can ask the system administrator to rename a directory and
temporarily create a symbolic link pointing to a directory 
where you can restore the files.
Other solutions exist, including editing the
<b>tar</b> archive, and creating a new directory structure with a
C program executing the
<b>chroot(2)</b> system call.
Another solution is to get the Free Software Foundation's
version of 
<b>tar</b> that allows you to remap pathnames starting with 
<b>/</b>. It also allows you to create archives that are too large for a single tape,
incremental archives, and a dozen other advantages.
<p>But the best solution is to never create an archive
of a directory that starts with 
<b>/</b> or
<b>~</b>. 
<p><h1><a name="uh-11" href="Tar.html#toc-uh-11">Remote Restoring</a></h1>
<p>To restore a directory from a remote host, use the following command:
<dl><dd>rsh -n host dd if=/dev/rst0 bs=20b | <br>
tar xvBfb - 20 <i>filenames</i><br>

</dl>
<p>Because of it's nature, it is difficult to read
fixed size blocks over a network.
This is why
<b>tar</b> uses the
<b>B</b> flag to force it to read from the pipe
until a block is completely filled.
